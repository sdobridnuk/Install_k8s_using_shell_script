* If the weave-net pod is in a crash loop state then check logs, it might the weave-net IP range is overlapping with the host networkÂ . we allocated IPrange of  10.32.0.0/16 by changing the default of cidr /12. If 10.32.0.0/16 overlaps then first delete the weave-net daemonset and change the range in the env IPALLOC_RANGE of file weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml and then apply this yaml file.
